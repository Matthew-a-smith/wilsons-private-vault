# About Me

I'm Matthew Smith, a cybersecurity student on a journey to become a penetration tester. My focus is on making digital spaces more secure by finding and fixing vulnerabilities.

In my studies, I'm learning to identify and address potential security issues. Beyond the classroom, I'm actively applying these skills to real-world challenges, contributing to the ever-changing field of cybersecurity.

I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest in ethical hacking and penetration testing, working towards making digital landscapes more resilient.

As I continue my academic journey, I'm excited to share my experiences and insights in the world of cybersecurity.

## Community Involvement

Outside the cybersecurity realm, I'm an active member of various communities:

### Zooniverse - Citizen Scientist

#### Beavers from Space

By analyzing satellite imagery for beaver dams and lodges in the waterways of the Kainai Nation in southern Alberta, Beavers from Space aims to determine the presence of beavers on the landscape. I contributed by detecting over 200 dams during this project, which concluded in September 2023.

#### Leo Virgo

I'm also involved in the Leo Virgo project, contributing to the observation of gravitational waves. Having confirmed over 900 glitches and parsed more than 4000 photos, I'm excited to participate in their upcoming project this May.
